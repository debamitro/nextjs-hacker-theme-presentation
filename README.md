# nextjs-hacker-theme-presentation

I used [v0](https://v0.dev) to generate a presentation. I liked the theme so much I saved it as a repo so that it can be re-used.

## How to use

Here's what you need to do to get started

```bash
npm install
npx shadcn add button card
npm run dev # for seeing the result in http://localhost:3000
```

## How to change the slides

Edit the 'slides' array in the file hacker-presentation-with-keyboard-nav.tsx
